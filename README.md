### Sentiment Analysis for different SmartPhone types 


The task of this project is to analyze sentiment on the web towards a number of smart phones for Helio, a smart phone and 
tablet app developer.

This suite of apps will enable the aid workers to manage local health conditions by facilitating communication with medical professionals located elsewhere.

Helio is in the process of evaluating phone types to determine which one to bundle their software with. 
 
 
 Goal: To examine the prevalence of positive and negative attitudes toward these devices on the web.
 
 Solution: Sentiment Analysis on AWS (Amazon Web Services) by using Common Crawl data(open repository of web crawl data).
